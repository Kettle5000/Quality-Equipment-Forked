Quality Equipment Forked
Fork version of Quality Equipment
This mod adds a massive amount of compatibility with other mods such as First aid, Trinkets and Baubles, Bountiful Baubles and Toolbelt
It also incorporates a proper datapack system to add custom qualities.
Highly recommended to play with my damage library for the damage resistance attribute to work better.
See example below.

Folder where qualities are stored are here:
data/quality_forked/qualities

This mod also adds a lot of modded attributes for use in other of my own mods and maybe for other people to use 

quality_forked:dig_speed -> careful, it can increase speed very agressively if used wrongly.
quality_forked:damage_resistance -> flat values reduce damage directly, so use carefully. Recommended to use with Progressive Mechanics Library.
quality_forked:projectile_damage -> handles damage increase. 
quality_forked:magic_damage -> increases magic damage done, soon to be configurable to allow cross compat with current magic mods.
quality_forked:magic_resistance -> counterpart of magic damage, flat values reduce damage directly.
quality_forked:jump_height -> handles jump height, starts with a default value of 1.
